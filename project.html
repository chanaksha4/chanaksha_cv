<h3> PROJECTS</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Driver Drowsiness detection</strong></li>
        A system that monitors a driver's level of alertness to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness or
fatigue. The system uses computer vision techniques, image processing algorithms and machine
learning algorithms to analyze the driver's eye movements. By continuously monitoring and
analyzing these signals, the system detects signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids and issues
timely alerts to the driver to take a break or regain focus.
        <li><strong>Virtual Paint using Artificial intelligence</strong></li>
        A system that leverages artificial intelligence techniques to enable users to create digital artwork in a virtual environment by utilizing computer vision and machine learning algorithms to track the user's hand movements and gestures in real-time. By analyzing these movements, the system can interpret
the user's intent and translate it into virtual brush strokes, colors, and other artistic elements.
        <li><strong>Recommender System and Personalization using NLP</strong></li>
        The system employs advanced NLP algorithms to extract meaningful insights from product
descriptions, names, and associated metadata. Through a combination of sentiment analysis,
keyword extraction, and semantic understanding, the system gains a nuanced understanding
of user preferences and contextual relevance.
        <li><strong>Emotional Analysis of Shadow and Social Personality using IoT and Machine Learning</strong></li>
        Analyze shadow and social personality traits through the integration of cutting-edge technologies.
Leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) devices equipped with audio, video, and environmental sensors,
we collect behavioral data across diverse settings. Advanced video analytics algorithms employ
computer vision techniques to discern facial expressions, gestures, and other behavioral cues from
the captured video streams.</ol>
